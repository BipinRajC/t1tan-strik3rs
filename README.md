The Soldier Health Monitoring and Position Tracking System allows the military personnel to track the current GPS position of a soldier and also checks the health status by detecting heartbeat of a soldier in realtime.


## **_Soldiers Health Monitoring and GPS Tracking System_**

#### **Introduction**

Modern warfare demands real-time solutions for soldier safety. Soldiers risk injury and getting lost during missions. Delayed medical attention or search efforts can be deadly and can jeopardize national security. This project proposes a soldier health and location tracking system. Sensors monitor vitals (heart rate, temperature) and location (GPS). Wireless communication transmits data to a Blynk application accessed on the PC. This unit tracks soldier location and health, triggering alerts for abnormal readings. This system can significantly improve soldier safety by ensuring faster medical response for injured personnel and reducing search times for lost soldiers. However, further considerations include data security, low-power sensor technology, and system scalability for large-scale deployment.

#### **Overview**

The Smart Soldier Gear project, integrated with VSD Squadron technology, enhances soldier safety and operational efficiency through advanced wearable systems. The gear includes a pulse sensor (RC-A-4015) to monitor vital health parameters continuously. Any deviations from predefined thresholds trigger emergency alerts. A GPS module tracks the soldierâ€™s real-time location. Data from these sensors are processed by a microcontroller and transmitted wirelessly via the HC12 RF transceiver directly to the Blynk cloud using the Blynk application. This setup enables real-time data visualization on a customized Blynk dashboard, ensuring continuous health and location monitoring and facilitating immediate responses in emergencies. This system significantly improves the situational awareness and operational readiness of soldiers.
