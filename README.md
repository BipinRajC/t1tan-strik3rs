The Soldier Health Monitoring and Position Tracking System allows the military personnel to track the current GPS position of a soldier and also checks the health status by detecting heartbeat of a soldier in realtime.


## **_Soldiers Health Monitoring and GPS Tracking System_**

#### **Introduction**

Modern warfare demands real-time solutions for soldier safety. Soldiers risk injury and getting lost during missions. Delayed medical attention or search efforts can be deadly and can jeopardize national security. This project proposes a soldier health and location tracking system. Sensors monitor vitals (heart rate, temperature) and location (GPS). Wireless communication transmits data to a Blynk application accessed on the PC. This unit tracks soldier location and health, triggering alerts for abnormal readings. This system can significantly improve soldier safety by ensuring faster medical response for injured personnel and reducing search times for lost soldiers. However, further considerations include data security, low-power sensor technology, and system scalability for large-scale deployment.

#### **Overview**

The Smart Soldier Gear project, integrated with VSD Squadron technology, enhances soldier safety and operational efficiency through advanced wearable systems. The gear includes a pulse sensor (RC-A-4015) to monitor vital health parameters continuously. Any deviations from predefined thresholds trigger emergency alerts. A GPS module tracks the soldierâ€™s real-time location. Data from these sensors are processed by a microcontroller and transmitted using pyplot. This setup enables real-time data visualization on a map , ensuring continuous location monitoring and facilitating immediate responses in emergencies. This system significantly improves the situational awareness and operational readiness of soldiers.

# Demo

This is the working of our project:

_Advantages: Keeping in mind the ultimate goal of this hackathon, that is fault injection, we believe that this could see it's applications in military wherein soldiers using such monitoring systems can keep the central unit updated about their positions and health vitals and in case of other countries' intelligence agencies trying to interfere with such systems, our aim is to pentest it and find a viable solution to safeguard such systems and keep our defences non-vulnerable and safe._

## **_Arduino code for pulse sensor interfacing and its working_**

```
// Define the pin where the pulse sensor is connected
const int pulsePin = A0;

// Variable to store the sensor value
int sensorValue = 0;

void setup() {
  // Initialize serial communication at 115200 bits per second
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  // Read the value from the pulse sensor
  sensorValue = analogRead(pulsePin);

  // Print the sensor value to the Serial Monitor and Serial Plotter
  Serial.println(sensorValue);

  // Wait for a short period before reading the value again
  delay(1000); // Adjust the delay as needed
}
```

## **_Fault injection in Pulse Sensor_**

Voltage glitching exploit involves momentarily disrupting the power supply to the microcontroller, causing it to behave unpredictably. 

Explanation: <br>
In  every 10 seconds (millis() % 10000 < 100 condition), a voltage glitch is simulated by setting sensorValue to its maximum possible value (1023 in Arduino's analogread scale).
This simulates a scenario where the microcontroller might experience a transient voltage spike or power disturbance.

##### **_Code for Pulse sensor Fault injection_**

```cpp
int sensorValue=0;
int pulsePin=A0;

void setup() {
  // Initialize serial communication at 115200 bits per second
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  // Simulate voltage glitch every 10 seconds
  if (millis() % 10000 < 100) { // Inject glitch for 100 milliseconds every 10 seconds
    // Simulate voltage glitch by resetting sensorValue to a high value
    sensorValue = 1023; // Max value glitch
  } else {
    // Read the value from the pulse sensor
    sensorValue = analogRead(pulsePin);
  }

  // Print the sensor value to the Serial Monitor and Serial Plotter
  Serial.println(sensorValue);

  // Wait for a short period before reading the value again
  delay(1000); // Adjust the delay as needed
}
```

## **_Securing the Fault in Pulse Sensor_**

The alpha parameter in the EMA filter 
(sensorValue Filtered = alpha * sensorValueRaw + (1 - alpha) * sensorValueFiltered;) 
- The controlling input of the exponential smoothing calculation is defined as the smoothing factor or the smoothing constant.
- Exponential functions are used to assign exponentially decreasing weights over time. 
- Fine-tune alpha based on the expected dynamics of your sensor readings and the severity of voltage faults encountered in your setup. <br>

}

  // Read the value from the pulse sensor

  // Apply EMA filter
  sensorValueFiltered = alpha * sensorValueRaw + (1 - alpha) * sensorValueFiltered;

  // Print the filtered sensor value to the Serial Monitor and Serial Plotter
  Serial.println(sensorValueFiltered);
